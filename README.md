TODO
====================
General improvements I (David) think could be made {
-Animation for blocks disappearing
-I know I was the one who suggested the name "Puyo Pop," but we could probably think of something better
-Perfect the color scheme/UI
}

-Bug fix everything (Game should never crash.)

-Need to not just remove the 4+ contiguous blocks, but remake the groups every time blocks disappear so the combo system can be implemented

-The game should not speed up so fast

-Add a preview of the next two blocks UP NEXT

-Add score features DONE

-Make it look prettier

-Refactor this mess of spaghetti code

====================
CURRENT STATUSES

David: I added a delay to combos so it feels more like the actual game. (Previously if you did a combo every block affected would disappear at once, now the blocks fall so it is more obvious what is happening, like in the actual game.) Still, there are some pesky, lingering bugs.

Adam: The blocks will now visibily rotate. I need to update basically every other method to account for proper collision detection.
