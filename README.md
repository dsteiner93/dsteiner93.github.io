CURRENT STATUSES

David: I have been working on implementing the feature where four contiguous blocks disappear. This is nearly done, I just need to implement the merge function and actually debug the part where it actually removes the circles from the canvas. (So the changes will be visible.)

Adam: The blocks will now visibily rotate. I need to update basically every other method to account for proper collision detection.
