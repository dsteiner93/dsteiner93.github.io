 X and Y axes represent the values of w1 and w2. w1 and w2 each took values in the range of -10 to 10<br>
 represented in this graph as 1 to 21. (-10 went into matrix index 1, 10 went into index 21.) See code below. <br>

<h1> How are the results with 0-1 loss and hinge loss different? </h1>

Hinge loss uses the value for f(x) instead of the decision sign(f(x)). <br>
0-1 loss is piecewise constant, hinge loss is not. <br>
Hinge loss is convex, allowing for easier optimization. <br>
Hinge loss continues to increase even as the maximum number of misclassifications has been reached, unlike 0-1 loss.
