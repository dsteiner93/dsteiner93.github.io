                        <br> 
			Our team's project is going to be to implement the Japenese video game Puyo Pop. <br>
			Puyo Pop (also known as Puyo Puyo, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, or Kirby's Avalanche) 
			is a tile-matching puzzle game (like Tetris). 
			<br> <br>
			The game takes place in a 12x6 grid. Blocks consisting of two colored blobs fall from the top 
			of the screen. The pace at which these blobs fall increases as the game progresses. (Like the 
			tertonimos in Tetris.) The blobs fall directly downward if not moved, but the player can also 
			move the blobs horizontally and rotate them as they fall. Blobs can take the following colors: 
			Green, Pink, Blue, Purple, and Orange. 
			<br> <br>
			The goal of the game is to last as long as possible without your screen filling up with blobs. 
			The key rule of the game is that if any four blobs of the same color form a tetronimo upon lan
			ding, they disappear. (In Tetris a row disappears if you have filled every space in the row. 
			In this game the four or more connected blobs of the same colour alone disappear.) When these 
			blobs disappear every blob that was on top of them in the column falls down. 
			<br> <br>
			Through making the blobs disappear, you can form combos. So if you match four blobs, they disa
			ppear, and then the blobs above them fall down to form another set of four or more connected b
			lobs, they will also disappear.  
			<br> <br>
			In two player mode, if you form one of these combos, garbage blobs will be dropped onto your o
			pponents grid. These garbage pieces can only be removed if they are next to a set of blobs when 
			they disappear. Garbage blobs are indicated by their grey or black color. 
			<br> <br>
			Our proposed project is to implement this game. This will first be done by implementing the one 
			player mode, where one player plays by themself as long as possible. Like Tetris, the difficulty
			would increase over time thanks to the increasing speed at which blobs fall. 
			<br> <br>
			A more abitious project is to implement the two player mode. On the client side this will require
			creating all the graphics for the game and implementing the physics of the falling blobs. On the 
			server side we will need to be able to match two users for them to play each other, as well as 
			make sure that what appears in each of the users' browsers is in sync. </p>
